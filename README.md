# Orbital Diagram

A orbital simulation using N-body Physics written in OpenGL. Currently, is hard coded for a diagram of the earth-moon system, but can be currently be coded (With difficulty) to any Newtonian simulation you like.

### How to use

Currently, the only interaction is a simple camera, that can be controlled with keyboard and mouse:

- w, s for forward and back
- a, d for left and right
- right click + cursor to change direction of camera
- up and down arrows control simulation speed from real time to 1s = 3 days

### Next steps

- Implement basic collisions (Inelastic with destruction)
- Get some Orbital Lines to see
- Skybox
